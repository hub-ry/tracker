# tracker

Super simple program to track winter2025 bulk 💪.

Uses MatPlotLib pyplot to visualize the data


## Version I -- File IO ~ Manual Entry
VersionI is a barebones version with little to no automation. Each day add_weight() must be called, and the "mm--dd-yy, weight" variable must be manually inputted to be written to the file. The stats function calculates "average of the average weight gain per week", a flawed statistic (becuase of outlier weeks). Option to print the list to terminal or display a simple MatPlotLib chart.

## Version II - File IO + Flask
VersionII is functional but not finished.
